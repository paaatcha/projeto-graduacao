# Undergraduate thesis

This repository is related to my undergraduate thesis (which we call by PG, projeto de graduação in Portuguese). 
I modeled a line follower robot that I developed to participate of the University Robotic Tournament (TUR). You can check this project [clicking here](http:github.com/paaatcha/TUR). 

Using the model, I project a PID controller and optimized it using the [Differential Evolution algorithm](https://github.com/paaatcha/Otimizacao/tree/master/DE). In addition, I also designed a Fuzzy controller to control the robot. In this thesis, I compared both controllers. Below, you can see the controllers response to the step function, which simulates the 90º turn on a track race):

The PG is available in [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6514yjd7py0hiyk/IF-TODIM%20An%20intuitionistic%20fuzzy%20TODIM%20to%20multi-criteria.pdf?dl=0), however, it's only in Brazilian-Portuguese.
